# Day 2 - To Do List

This is a basic To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks by clicking on a delete icon.

## Features
- Add Task: Enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

- Mark as Completed: Click on a task to mark it as completed. The completed task will be visually differentiated by a strike-through effect.

- Delete Task: Click on the "x" icon next to a task to delete it from the list.

- Data Persistence: The app uses local storage to store task data, ensuring that your tasks are saved even when you refresh the page.
