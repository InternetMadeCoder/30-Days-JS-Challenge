# Simple Snake Game
This is a basic implementation of a snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to control a snake and navigate it around a grid to eat food and grow in size, while avoiding collisions with itself and the game board boundaries.

## How to Play

- **Movement :** Use the arrow keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) to control the direction of the snake. Alternatively, click on the directional buttons on the screen to change the snake's direction.

- **Eating Food :** Guide the snake to eat the food (üçé) displayed on the board. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases.

- **Avoid Collisions :** Be careful not to let the snake collide with itself or the edges of the game board.
